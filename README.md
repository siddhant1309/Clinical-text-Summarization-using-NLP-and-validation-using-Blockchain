In response to the pervasive issue of EHR tampering, our system emerges as a robust solution, ensuring unwavering data integrity. Traditional EHRs face vulnerabilities to unauthorized alterations, necessitating a strategic interven-tion. This breakthrough not only enhances patient access but also fortifies control, reinforcing the reliability of the healthcare system. Operating at the intersection of advanced technologies, including summarizers, OCR, and Blockchain, our system systematically addresses the vulnerabilities inherent in conventional EHRs. Digitization facilitates swift access to critical health records during the Golden Hour, a pivotal window for emergency medical interventions. Our innovative use of summarization techniques streamlines clinical text, making it more accessible to patients while retaining essential medical information. Exploring optimal summarizers and presenting services as REST API services distribute computation load for faster response times and component independence. The incorporation of Blockchain safeguards against tampering and ensures transparent, auditable transactions, fostering trust among patients and medical professionals. This multifaceted approach marks a substantial leap towards a secure healthcare ecosystem, contributing meaningfully to the discourse on patient data security and medical outcomes optimization. Beyond its immediate impact, our project promises transforma-tive influence on the broader healthcare landscape.
