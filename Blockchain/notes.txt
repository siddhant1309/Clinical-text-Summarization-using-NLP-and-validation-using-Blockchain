next js uses server side rendering
the server takes react app, renders the entire react app itself, all js code is executed on the next server
next server sends down completely rendered html document, makes the procedure faster than create react app.
after sending html doc later next sends down js code as well
first renders html doc for the user before js rendering


server side rendering attempts to render our component on server side nad sends the html and sends it to our browser
componentdidmount is not executed on the server side of the next js, hence this data fetching is not done
getinitialprops is a lifecycle methods used exclusively by next js. it wants to access certain data without rendering the complete component making rendering more efficient
